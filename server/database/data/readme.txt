National Student Survey

The National Student Survey was updated in 2025 following a major review and consultation. As a result, the survey questions and response scales have changed for NSS 2025. The updated survey asks students in the UK questions about a range of factors related to their academic experience, including the teaching on their course, assessment and feedback, and how well courses are organised. The 2025 survey also asked students about mental wellbeing services and, in England, about freedom of expression for the first time. New direct questions with item-specific response scales have been introduced to improve students’ understanding and to enhance the accuracy of results.

As the 2025 survey has been updated, it is not valid to either compare question responses or combine data from the NSS 2025 with those from previous years. Therefore, the NSS data displayed in the Discover Uni dataset is for two years, taken from students who were in their final year of their higher education course during the academic years 2023-2024 and 2024-2025.

Teaching and Excellence Framework (TEF)

From 11th October 2023, the TEF ratings for participating providers will be included in the Discover Uni dataset. The TEF is a national scheme run by the Office for Students (OfS) that aims to encourage higher education providers to improve and deliver excellence in the areas that students care about the most: teaching, learning and achieving positive outcomes from their studies.  The TEF does this by assessing and rating universities and colleges for excellence above a set of minimum requirements for quality and standards. Providers that take part in the TEF receive an overall rating as well as two underpinning ratings – one for the student experience and one for student outcomes. 

The Discover Uni .csv files have been included in this folder to enable users to load .csv versions of the kis.xml file entities into their databases for analysis.

The .csv file structure is based on that created for the Discover Uni output .xml file with some exceptions (see paragraph below). 

This documentation includes details of the parent entity, field description, field type, min/max occurrence, field length and additional notes.  Field information for the .csv lookup tables (ACCREDITATIONTABLE.csv, KISAIM.csv, LOCATION.csv, GOSECSAL.csv, LEO3SECSAL.csv and LEO5SECSAL.csv), plus the two additional .csv entities (UCASCOURSEID.csv and SBJ.csv (created to hold the COURSELOCATION UCASCOURSEID and KISCourse SBJ repeating fields)), can be found in the 'Discover Uni dataset file structure and description'
