## Coding styles
| Style | Characteristic |
|-------|----------------|
| Excellent | Modules (subroutines) with appropriate interfaces. |
|         | Loosely coupled modules (subroutines) – module code interacts with other parts of the program through its interface only. |
|         | Cohesive modules (subroutines) – module code does just one thing. |
|         | Modules(collections of subroutines) – subroutines with common purpose grouped. |
|         | Defensive programming. |
|         | Good exception handling. |


## Testing (8 marks)

Level	Mark range	Description
| Level | Mark range | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 4     | 7-8        | Clear evidence, in the form of carefully selected representative samples, that thorough testing has been carried out. This demonstrates the robustness of the complete or nearly complete solution/thoroughness of investigation and that the requirements of the solution/investigation have been achieved. |

##  Evaluation (4 marks)

| Level | Mark | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
|   4   |  4   | - Full consideration given to how well the outcome meets all of its requirements.<br>- How the outcome could be improved if the problem was revisited is discussed and given detailed consideration.<br>- Independent feedback obtained of a useful and realistic nature, evaluated and discussed in a meaningful way. |
